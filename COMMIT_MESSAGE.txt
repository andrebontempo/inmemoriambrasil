temp: add dev-only global session cookie fallback; remove per-controller forcing and heavy debug logging

- Add DEV-only global fallback middleware to attach Set-Cookie when express-session doesn't (guarded by NODE_ENV and FORCE_SET_COOKIE).
- Remove per-controller cookie forcing and the previous debug interceptor to keep the workaround centralized.

Notes:
- This is a temporary, low-risk workaround to unblock local testing. Follow-up: investigate why express-session isn't setting Set-Cookie in local HTTP (secure cookie behaviour, trust proxy, or version mismatch).

Suggested local git commands:

# review changes
git status
git add server.js app/controllers/AuthController.js DEV_NOTES.md
# create a clear commit
git commit -m "temp: add dev-only global session cookie fallback; remove per-controller fallback and debug logging"
# push to remote
git push origin main
